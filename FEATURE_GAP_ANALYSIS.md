## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation Details

### **Database Schema Updates Required**

#### New Tables Needed:
```sql
-- Orders table (enhanced from projects)
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_number VARCHAR UNIQUE,
  status VARCHAR CHECK (status IN ('draft', 'processing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'completed')),
  team_members JSONB,
  attachments JSONB,
  -- ... existing project fields
);

-- Invoices table
CREATE TABLE invoices (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders(id),
  zoho_invoice_id VARCHAR,
  invoice_number VARCHAR,
  amount DECIMAL,
  status VARCHAR,
  pdf_url VARCHAR,
  due_date DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Tasks table
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders(id),
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  assigned_to UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  priority VARCHAR CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
  status VARCHAR CHECK (status IN ('todo', 'in_progress', 'done')),
  due_date DATE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Notifications table
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  message TEXT,
  type VARCHAR,
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **API Integration Requirements**

#### Zoho Invoice API Setup:
```typescript
// src/lib/zoho-invoice.ts
interface ZohoInvoiceConfig {
  clientId: string;
  clientSecret: string;
  refreshToken: string;
  organizationId: string;
}

interface ZohoInvoiceAPI {
  createInvoice(orderData: Order): Promise<Invoice>;
  getInvoice(invoiceId: string): Promise<Invoice>;
  sendInvoiceEmail(invoiceId: string, email: string): Promise<void>;
  getInvoicePDF(invoiceId: string): Promise<Buffer>;
}
```

#### Environment Variables to Add:
```
ZOHO_INVOICE_CLIENT_ID=
ZOHO_INVOICE_CLIENT_SECRET=
ZOHO_INVOICE_REFRESH_TOKEN=
ZOHO_ORGANIZATION_ID=
ZOHO_PAYMENT_CLIENT_ID=
ZOHO_PAYMENT_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

## ðŸš€ Implementation Roadmap

### **Week 1: Database & Core APIs**
- Set up new database tables
- Create basic API routes for orders, invoices, tasks
- Implement Zoho API authentication

### **Week 2: UI Components & Forms**
- Build order management interface
- Create invoice generation forms
- Implement task assignment UI

### **Week 3: Integration & Testing**
- Connect Zoho Invoice API
- Implement file upload system
- Create notification system

### **Week 4: Advanced Features**
- Enhanced reporting dashboard
- Email system integration
- User role enhancements

### **Week 5: Testing & Deployment**
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment

---

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Wins (Can be implemented immediately)

1. **Update User Roles**: Add finance and client roles to existing system
2. **Enhance Project Status**: Expand status options to match PRD
3. **Add File Upload**: Basic file attachment using Supabase Storage
4. **Notification UI**: Create basic notification center component

---

## ðŸ”„ Migration Strategy

### **Existing Data Migration**
- Projects â†’ Orders: Migrate existing project data to enhanced order structure
- Users: Add new role fields and permissions
- Payments: Ensure compatibility with new invoice system

### **Zero-Downtime Approach**
1. Deploy new features as optional/beta
2. Gradually migrate data in background
3. Switch over when ready
4. Remove legacy code

---

## âš¡ Estimated Development Time

| Phase | Features | Time Estimate |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Phase 1 | Orders, Invoices, Tasks | 2-3 weeks |
| Phase 2 | User Management, Files, Notifications | 1-2 weeks |
| Phase 3 | Advanced Features, Polish | 1 week |
| **Total** | **Complete PRD Implementation** | **4-6 weeks** |

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

- [ ] All PRD modules implemented and functional
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] User adoption of new features >80%
- [ ] Invoice processing automated
- [ ] Task completion tracking operational
